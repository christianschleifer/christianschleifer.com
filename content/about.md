Welcome to my blog! I'm Christian, a 29-year-old software engineer based in Munich. Although I studied medicine and
didn't pursue a formal education in computer science, I have developed a passion for technology and computer science
concepts. Through this blog, I aim to share my journey of learning and exploring these fascinating subjects.

Join me as I explore various tech and computer science topics that capture my interest. As a self-taught developer, I
understand the importance of not shying away from understanding the inner workings of abstractions. I hope to provide
guidance and insights on how you too can embrace a similar approach, empowering you to become a confident and
knowledgeable developer.

Get ready to unravel the complexities of the tech world with me as your guide. Together, we'll navigate the intricacies
of this ever-evolving field and uncover the magic behind the technology we interact with every day.
