Welcome to my blog. My name is Christian. I'm a 28-years-old software engineer living in Munich. I studied medicine and 
have never undergone a formal computer science education. In this blog I want to write about tech and computer science concepts
I'm currently learning about. I also want to provide some guidance on how to become a self-taught developer who 
doesn't scare away from looking under the hood of abstractions.
