## Designing Data-Intensive Applications: Martin Kleppmann

If you want to learn the ins and outs of data handling in modern, distributed systems, look no further. Martin Kleppmann
does an incredible job at explaining which tradeoffs you'll have to make with which data store.
Especially the "Part II. Distributed Data" is truly enlightening.

## Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces: Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau

I cannot but admire the authors on their ability to convey complex topics in an understandable way. Having structured
the book into three sections - Virtualization, Concurrency and Persistence - Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau dive deep
on how to securely share computer hardware across multiple programs, the pitfalls of running things on multiple
processors and the challenges involved in persisting data to disk. This is your go-to book if you sometimes find
yourself `strace`ing programs, and you want to know what actually happens there.

## Computer Networking - A Top-Down Approach: James Kurose, Keith Ross

Computer networking made easy. Easy but not superficial! In fact, this book explores the details of the protocols
building the foundation for computer networks and the Internet in particular.
I cannot tell you how many times the knowledge gained from this book has saved my a** at work. After all, it's always
DNS or network.

## Effective Java - Third Edition: Joshua Bloch

Definitely no introductory book to the Java programming language. But as soon as you have learnt the basic syntax of
Java, I'd highly recommend reading the book. Joshua Bloch is an industry expert who has taken part in designing and
implementing Java platform features. Nevertheless, the book is written in an easily understandable language. True
experts can express complex problems with simple words!

## Java Concurrency in Practice: Brian Goetz

This book has been on my list for long. This Christmas, I took the time to read it. And it was well worth the time. This
book doesn't merely show you the API of concurrency classes in Java (which you could easily do on your own using the
Java docs), but discusses and explains the trade-offs that were made when designing these classes. I especially like the
section on the Java memory model. If you ever wondered what the effects of the `volatile` keyword in Java are, then this
is the book for you.
