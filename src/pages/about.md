Welcome to my blog! I'm Christian, a 30-year-old software engineer based in Munich. Although I studied medicine and
didn't pursue a formal education in computer science, I have developed a passion for technology and computer science
concepts. Through this blog, I aim to share my journey of learning and exploring tech stuff I'm interested in.

How does the Linux kernel represent processes? How does virtual memory work? What are all these networking layers really
about? How do database indices work? What is asynchronous I/O really about? Questions like these get me super excited. I
love to peek behind abstractions and explore their actual implementation. Sometimes only on a conceptual level,
sometimes with coding out some bare-bones implementations myself.

I myself benefited a lot from reading blog posts which is why I hope this blog may benefit you as well.
